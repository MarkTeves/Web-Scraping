    title: Beautiful colors
    review: I bought the green motif and the colors are beautiful and look just like the picture. as others have mentioned, it does have a high slit on the side that has a tendency to separate and look bulky. i just put a couple of small hooks to keep it together. i normally would wear a medium or large, but based on other reviews, i ordered down to the small and it was perfect. since i live in the south where it can stay quite warm through fall, it will be a great transitional piece.

    title: Shoulders are puffy
    review: This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.

    title: Love this!
    review: I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful

    title: Peplum top
    review: The picture is accurate. i got the plum version. the color and effect are really unique. the fit is tts. i wear an 8 in tops and the medium is fine. the sleeves are flattering-  belled but not ridiculous. the fabric is soft. if the body of the top was a little less wide it would be a 5 star item. with flare legs, i think it will balance out the volume of the cut.

    title: My new favorite jacket
    review: I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it. i have the green version, and the color is lovely. the sleeves are the perfect length ( i got a petite size) and it is very flattering. the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy, snowy day, but is perfect for cool fall days.

    title: Lovely but large
    review: As other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas, however, it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it, sadly.

    title: Perfect for spring
    review: Adorable, true to size and just as pictured. there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute. light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks. wish there were additional colors. i love the white though.

    title: Love this, with reservation
    review: I love tunics, i love sweaters, i love turquoise. i ordered this in large, and it fits well, but the arms are very long. i don't like constantly pushing sleeves up so i wear it with the cuffs turned back. a previous reviewer commented on the length and another about the bagginess. i didn't have issues with either. it hits just above my knee (5'5") and it is appropriately proportioned around the the body of the sweater. so what's my reservation? how the sweater is more delicate than it seems. the

    title: Love, love, love
    review: I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.

    title: Great sweater - runs big!
    review: I originally purchased this sweater in a size small (5'4 125lbs) and i was swimming in it! i went into the store and exchanged it for a size xs and it still runs a little big. i do love the quality though and its so soft! it's made of a sweatshirt like material which gives it a lazy sunday feel. it is definitely more casual than your typical cardigan but is so cozy! this is quickly becoming a go to for after yoga or just lazy sundays at home. great product!

    title: Enveloping cacoon of warmth
    review: I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl

    title: Xl fits small, light blue is pretty
    review: I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. i would

    title: Perfect....for two wears
    review: Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.

    title: Beautiful sweater!
    review: I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute. the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile. this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer.

    title: Cute shirt
    review: I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute, but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.

    title: Darling top- runs large and long!
    review: I am a solid size 6 in most brands, top and bottom, 5'3" tall, 125#. i have long legs, short torso, and fairly broad shoulders - i almost never wear petite sizes.however, this top in the regular small size could be a maternity dress on me! i am literally swimming in it, and it is quite long. however, i can still make it work, with a cami underneath and leggings or skinny jeans... i like it, did not return, and will buy another color, but will go with petite x-small in the future.

    title: This top is beautiful
    review: The top is gorge, it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great, especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag, do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.

    title: Short and small

    title: Good summer datetop
    review: This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer. it's versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy, feminine feel. i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully. the yellow behind the white is also very pretty. it's fuller than it looks in the product shots. even in an xxs, it's long on me at 5'4" but it's fine. not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini. the neck is also a little h

    title: Love the colors, not a fan of the side slit
    review: Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great, comfortable fit, but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.

    title: Better in person
    review: I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe

    title: Very nice, but also very flowey
    review: I was surprised when my friend tried this on (they dind't have my size in store so she did), how ,uch materil there is on this top. it is very beautiful, but might be too much on a petite frame. the back is almost like a mini train, which is pretty ocol in my opinion. great colros in person too, yes, a tiny bit of shimmer  -)

    title: Not sure what i wore before i owned this shirt!
    review: I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou

    title: Too itchy for me
    review: I was searching for an ivory cardigan and i ordered this in my usual size small and an extra small. after trying them both on, the xs looked better, i like a more fitted look. a tad tight i the arms when layered but otherwise would have been a good fit, but the acrylic in this garment was too itchy for me around the neck. i thought this might be the case but took a chance anyway. also the pockets add a bit of bulk in the hip area, definitely not something i want.

    title: Old retailer
    review: Ok, so yes, it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little, especially if you work out, but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0, didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short, i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses, tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic, flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a

    title: Boxy and runs huge
    review: I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern, when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale, which it definitely will be, but even then am not positive i would keep it.

    title: Only the sleeves are pretty; the rest is terrible
    review: The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t

    title: Versatile off the shoulder
    review: Cloth & stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer! they consistently produce versatile, comfortable and quality pieces time and again. off the shoulder is back and here to stay, and without a doubt, this is one of the best i've tried on. the denim is a perfect, summery shade, but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans. i am 5'7, shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad, and a little busty - i got a size m and it fits great. i absolutely love my shir

    title: Wanted to love this
    review: The fabric is wonderful, flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7", 145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a "pooch", never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung

    title: Great top!
    review: This is a really nice top, especially for the price. i am 5'6", 34dd, 140 lbs and normally wear a medium in dolan tops. in this top i purchased size small since the gathered front provides ample room for my bust. some reviewers have found this top to be on the "boxy" side. i can see that if you don't size down as i did. i found the medium to have too much fabric and look very baggy whereas the small was perfect. i do wish this top was a tad bit longer and less sheer, though. white tops should be

    title: Too boxy, pretty material
    review: I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.

    title: Comfy tee, but beware of color names!
    review: I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the "red", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the "red" tee is actually a light orange color. the "orange" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!

    title: Lots of very nice details
    review: This henley has a lot of very nice details (lace, embroidery). the material is soft and a little bit sheer (more so in the lacey sections). it is made in india and the style strikes me as a bit indian looking. the only thing i do not like is that there are two buttons along the v shape decolltage..but there are no button holes on the other side so they are purely for decoration (you can see those buttons in the enlarged detail view only). this irks me a bit, because i would like to button the sh

    title: Cute, but not on me!
    review: I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!

    title: Casual, fun use of plaid
    review: The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.

    title: Very see through
    review: I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.it is cute though!

    title: Too sheer for me
    review: I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.

    title: Shapeless and itchy sweater
    review: I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters

    title: Beautiful summer top
    review: I am very pleased with this purchase. a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through.   i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both. it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work  paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan.   i am a 34a  and size small  fits nicely.

    title: So much prettier than pictured!
    review: I agree with the previous review, i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat, it is quite short. i am 5'10", 135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed.

    title: Perfect warm weather tank with a twist
    review: This is a great light weight tank. true to size, but size up if you prefer a baggier fit, size down for a closer fit. your preference for fit should be your guide. (i prefer a closer fit, so i choose a xs, i am a 6-8 in tops) the arm holes are slim and high so you are completely covered in all sizes. excellent drape, the twist in the front is just perfect! looks great with jeans, print joggers, and even wide leg pants. i imagine it would be fantastic with a pencil skirt - denim perhaps. hope it

    title: Must buy!
    review: This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower, close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute, long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual

    title: Great transitioning top
    review: It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.

    title: Elegant top
    review: I was shopping for a holiday outfit today at my retailer store, and my sales associate suggested i try on this top. i have lo idea where it was on the store l, yet it's a very pretty top that stands out when you have it on. i took this in a small because it's meant to run shorter. i felt xs would have been too small. i purchased it to wear with jeans or dress pants. pretty detail. blouse shows off my arms and minimizes my waist. i love it!

    title: Runs small
    review: Ordered online, just received this vest, so disappointed! love the garment but it is way too small. i wear a medium in most clothing and size 6 in a dress, but the medium in this vest isn't just snug it is definitely too small, even worn alone, i can't button it. i am now ordering the large and keeping my fingers crossed as i want to wear a tee under it. hoping i won't need to return both the m and the l, thinking of ordering an xl.

    title: Really nice tee
    review: I got this tee for a great price online and i did like it a lot. i got it in medium and i might have liked it better if it was just a bit bigger or if the material wasn't quite so clingy. i decided it had to go back.

    title: Beautifully made, quality top
    review: I fell in love with this top on the spot and paid full price for it, which is a rarity, since everything goes on sale. it's a beautify top, well made and sits well on me. i am 5'6", usually wear a size 10 but got away with an 8 in this one. i do have short torso, so i can see it having a problem for someone with long torso or someone who's tall. what's even better is that it went on sale and the store was nice enough to give me the difference back. i'm thinking about getting the other two colors

    title: Cozy soft
    review: This sweater is buttery soft and warm. it is long and you will want every color. i bought the sky blue and it looks fabulous with so many outfits. i had to get the gray color also. the sleeves are a soft fitted rib material and the body is long and roomy. love love!

    title: Loved the style but was too short on me
    review: I loved the pattern, color and mock turtleneck style of this top, but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5", 32d, 110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work, but every time i raised my arms, you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also, and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s

    title: All-around quality, but big
    review: This is a top-flight notch  an attractive design, nicely made. for me, the fabric is rather heavy for summer wear, but that won't prevent me from keeping it for cooler days. my one complaint is the sizing. i weigh a bottom-heavy 146 lbs. and hoped i'd get away with a medium. but it swims on me...not "a bit too large," but "way too large." i'm returning it and hoping that a small will be small enough.

    title: Beautiful but must dry lean
    review: This sweater is gorgeous, i wish i could have purchased in several colors because it's now a staple in my closet. downside- it does say delicate cold water wash, but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it, so dry cleaning is the way to go. the sweater does snag easily, so don't wear anything that could get caught in it (jewelry/handbags with chains or embellishments) because they will catch.

    title: Cute, casual top
    review: I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.

    title: Sloppy, shapeless, ginormous top
    review: I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute, feminine details.

    title: Perfect
    review: I've received so many compliments. it's comfy and cute looking. the sleeves are a little short--which i wasn't expecting, but i love it nonetheless. just putting that out there in case you couldn't tell from the picture. i ordered an xs

    review: Super thick material and it's lined with cotton so as not to be scratchy on the skin. it looks cute on, hopefully it will soften over time. almost thick like upholstery fabric.

    title: Awkward fit
    review: I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side, it's gorgeous.

    title: Fun little tank!
    review: Love this. the stripes are cute and simple, but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank, so there is a lot of fabric, but styled the right way and this is dreamy  ) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two  )

    title: This style runs very large
    review: This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric , but the size was overwhelming so i returned it.

    title: Perfect!
    review: Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.

    title: Love it... but size up!
    review: I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10, and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer, even with the lining. worth it though!

    title: Shrunk terribly
    review: I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!

    title: Super huge top
    review: I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.

    title: Sparkles and lace a nice touch
    review: I got this top in the beige, size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it, they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.

    title: Disappointed
    review: I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.

    title: Soft, flattering, warm and versatile!
    review: I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming

    title: Top is too shear with see through front
    review: This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol

    title: Very pretty sweater
    review: I love this sweater! the sky color is very flattering in person. i love that it looks good open or closed. i bought one for my mom and me. i think it will be very versatile. i think it runs mostly true to size, possibly runs just slightly big.

    title: Nice surprise
    review: I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts, but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches, but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a

    title: Pretty but fussy
    review: Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi  36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted topsthis top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams.

    title: Perfect, elegant & complimentary
    review: Love this shirt. i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt. i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look. i am 5'4 125 lbs (not pregnant) and got a size small. and it fits perfectly. covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs, yet accentuates the waist. and thinner area of legs. very soft fabric, a bit stretc

    title: Just ok.
    review: I found the color to be a bit blah, and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also, because of its "chunkiness," it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model.

    title: Not doing anything for me
    review: Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.

    title: Nice cardi
    review: I wish i had sized up on this one. you can't tell from the photo, but has kind of a weird taper thing where the sides are shorter than the back. the back is extremely flatteringly, but the front... not so much. the shorter sides are a little awkward. there is no attached way to fasten this cardigan, and it lays kind of strange. the material is a medium thickness and i think will be very versatile. very soft, of course. i got the blue/ teal color. i found the color to be true to the color on-line

    review: The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,

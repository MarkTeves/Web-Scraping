    title: Nice tee, but i was not aware how cropped it is
    review: The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still, very nice tee, i love cotton, it simply is the best. colors are nice too.

    title: Cosy and roomy
    review: This is a very nice top, but it is very loose and swingy indeed. i sized down one size, and it still is very relaxes. the material is soft, the colors are nice.

    title: Amazing, versatile shirt
    review: Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases! the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items. the turtle neck will help keep you warm, although the actual material is a little thin. don't let that dissuade you though. you won't be disappointed by this purchase! i'm going to get the other color too  )

    title: So much prettier online
    review: I stalked this when it went out of stock for a few weeks and was so excited when it came back in stock. but when it arrived, it just didn't look as good. it's very oversized. and it's itchy and kind of synthetic-looking. i felt like it added bulk when i tried it on. the collar also didn't fold gently like it does in the pictures. returned it!

    title: New fall staple
    review: I love this top. it's so soft and the cut is so flattering for a sweater! the sleeve holes are low enough so that you could easily layer underneath it but high enough to be work alone. the knit is a perfect fall thickeness...warm but not too thick. i am 5'11" 130lbs and i got the medium for the extra length.

    title: Lovely cozy and stylish sweater
    review: It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!

    review: Love the top design, not so much the fabric. i should've read the top was 100% polyester. returning and finding a better quality top.

    title: Not a sweatshirt
    review: If you're expecting a sweatshirt when you order this, you might be disappointed. it's actually more like a banded t-shirt, which i don't mind. i'm 5'2" and the length comes just below the button on my jeans. perfect length for us shorter gals. sleeves are quite long on me, but i like to wear them pushed up anyways (and they actually stay up). i wouldn't pay full price for this, but it's a nice top at the sale price. cute with destroyed jeans or black leggings.

    title: Shrunk!

    title: Great sweater
    review: Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater, buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white, which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt, for the "sweater dress" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket.

    title: Not for me...
    review: This vest is a really cute idea for layering, so i ordered my usual size medium. and while it fit, it just added about 5-10 pounds onto my frame! ehhh the front just has this extra fabric that you are supposed to bunch up and then tie down, but it just made me look so bulky! sizing down wouldn't have helped as the back would have been squeezed in a small. it's a shame because it seems pretty well made and comfortable too. i'm 5'6", 140, and usually wear a 6 or 8.

    title: Too boxy for petite frame
    review: This was a bit of a disappointment. the colors are beautiful, but the shape was not flattering on my petite frame. it is somewhat wide and boxy in the shoulders and body. the fabric is stiffer that i expected, and therefore it doesn't drape nicely on the shoulders and through the torso. if you look closely at the model, you can see what i am talking about at the shoulder. the shoulders stick out a tad, and the gathering at the neck contributes to the larger, boxy look. this might look nice on th

    title: Just what i needed!
    review: I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan, that i've had for years, was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged, so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill, with a perfect fit and lovely texture, making it not just your average sweater, to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!

    title: So much fabric...
    review: Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try

    title: Pros & cons
    review: I am 5' 8", 145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore, i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however, the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore, i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j

    title: Size down 1-2 sizes
    review: I am normally a m-l (170 lbs, 5'4", 34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big, and it is huge. seriously, i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing, but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i'm going try and return it for a small. hey, i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty, and it's so soft. just need a much smaller size.

    title: Salt and pepper
    review: First of all i need to state that i am 5,1". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel, it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan, there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c

    title: Comfy but no good
    review: The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on, however the material is thin and slightly see through.also, after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it, i discovered a large hole in the armpit, most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.

    title: Boxy
    review: The fit of this top on me was much more boxy than on the model, maybe the fault of my fuller bust. my usual small definitely didn't reach my hips as it does hers, and appears wider. i'm not even sure the v is as deep! again, could be me. but i'm keeping the top because it is just so darn comfortable. as for not looking too top-heavy, ill just have to make it work.

    title: Too wide
    review: The detail on this top is beautiful, love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad, but it is much too wide, bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is, another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides, because the top does not lay like that. it runs large, especially under the arms. too bad......

    title: Floral print is gorgeous in person
    review: I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me, the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length, it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but, overall, it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ

    title: Softest, most flattering sweater
    review: I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package, i could not believe how soft it was. literally, as a cloud. think of the softest, fluffiest baby blanket. also, the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7", 135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly, flowing, but not boxy. love it!

    title: Pretty blouse
    review: I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.

    title: Soft, great fit, thin
    review: I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer, but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming, right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.

    title: I love this shirt
    review: I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i

    review: My favorite colors are purple and green, so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves, i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it, just huge, flowy, green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it, but now that i'm trying it on in the house, i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t

    title: A flattering over-sized shirt
    review: I generally wear a small or medium in tops, and decided to get the medium/large. it's over-sized, but it lays very nicely and doesn't look "frumpy". the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture. the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown, but still lovely.

    review: But when i saw this top in person, urged by my stylist when they got it in, i decided to try it on. they had xs in store, my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look, and not sure if smaller would work, i decided to order all three  xxs, xsp and xxsp!verdict on size  xxsp was pulling at the arm holes, kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right, but arm holes were a little high, not as comfortable.xsp ended up being the right c

    review: This cardigan did not disappoint. i purchased the orange, which is a beautiful deep red orange that is perfect for fall. the fit is true to size and the length of the cardigan is nice, hitting at mid hip. the ruffles hang well and are not too bulky or overwhelming on my petite frame. it looks great from the side as well. i love the knitted details, the scallops, and the subtle gathers. the only flaw is that the sleeves are way too long to be practical. they come to my fingertips, so get in the w

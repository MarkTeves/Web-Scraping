    title: Lovely flowing top with detail
    review: Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.

    title: Love!
    review: This is a lovely jacket. i thought it was going to be thicker, but it's so classy and chic. i got several comments on it, and i've only worn it once! great jacket to have in my closet. i can wear it to work, to dress up an outfit for school, or to complete an outfit.

    title: Strange dimensions
    review: It's beautiful, lovely quality, gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium, which is what i got, it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately

    title: Pretty and flowy
    review: A successful first date sweater. the cut is flowy so don't expect snug. the quality is average for retailer sweaters, i guess nothing will ever be pill-free? the detailing at the bust reveals a little of what lies beneath, which in my case was just a bra but in more conservative environs might have to be a camisole.

    title: Beautiful sweater but not flattering on me
    review: Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.

    title: Perfect fall cape.....easy to wear!
    review: Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und

    title: I recommend with caveats
    review: I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer

    title: Business in front; party in the back
    review: I tried this sweater on in-store in grey. from front it appears like a nice, normal sweater, even a little boring. but the side and back are *wow* really fun! the colors and swing of the back material look great, especially with jeans. the front is short, making you wonder if it's supposed to be a crop top. also, the style of the sweater lets isn't very warm because the back is so loose and flowy. i couldn't decide whether to buy it or not. maybe i will wait for a sale.

    review: I loved this top when i tried it on. i'm usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly, i am going to return it. if you don't have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help, but don't really want to have to wear a camisole in the

    review: I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s, so i went with a medium. fortunately for me, this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large, i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality, the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!

    title: Odd color...
    review: I wanted to love this top... it's gorgeous w/the beading and velvet. however, it really goes with nothing. i'm tall and slender... the top felt a bit cropped when i tried it on. very wide flare shape... but that wouldn't make me return it. what is making me send it back is the color. the grey is gorgeous, but the fabric is a buttery yellow color. i think i was picturing it more cream. i don't know what in the world you could wear this with... grey pants?! a grey pencil skirt?! it looks terrible

    title: Double v
    review: Thin and soft. lays nicely... form-fitting, but with enough fabric to move around and scrunch up without looking tight. the double-v makes it shift downward so the cut in front is pretty low - i have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't show too much. not sure how it'll hold up after a couple washes because the fabric is so lightweight.

    review: First of all i need to state that i am 5,1". i usually get the petite size small but they were out so i took a risk and ordered the regular small which i can sometimes get away with. upon opening the parcel, it seemed bigger than i expected. the knit is very chunky (not a bad thing) but thicker than i expected. the fit was way too large for me. the shoulders were bulky and because it is a cocoon shaped cardigan, there was just too much excess fabric draping around my petite frame. i think if i c

    review: This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo. i love that it goes with the off-the-shoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra - in fact, it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place (awesome detail). the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms, length hit at about my hip (5'7" with long torso; 125lbs, 32b) and, and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit. i found this to fit tts (bought my usual s). beautiful vivid print looks great with wh

    review: Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.

    title: Still undecided
    review: Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere, it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said, you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.

    review: The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra, no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top, because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package, it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated, it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the

    review: I got this in black, size medium, my usual size. i am fairly "curvy" on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure. it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom & indeed through the body itself. since i'm slim there, i will have to tailor it, am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest. but i'm keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe. good job retailer!

    review: I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.

    title: Nice simple sweater
    review: This is a great sweater just to throw on with jeans or a skirt. simple and the tie on the back gives it a feminine flare

    title: Loved it so much i bought a second!
    review: This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.

    title: Basic black bonus
    review: Just a little scallop makes this top special. if your on the edge of a 10 i suggest sizing up. fabric crisp-well made and worth full price

    title: Cute top, but short and boxy
    review: Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!

    title: Perfect for pear-shape
    review: I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top. the draping is very flattering to my shape. the material is soft and the flowers/colors are appropriate for work. it's the perfect length too. i love everything about the cut of this top. the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered. i love the knot effect along the waist. great purchase. hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patterns/colors for spring/summer timeframe. these are a little too dark/heav

    title: Heavier fabric & flattering
    review: I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.

    title: Love it!
    review: Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!

    title: Great, but size down.
    review: I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend "cold shoulder" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo

    title: Gorgeous
    review: Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).

    title: Will get lots of use
    review: I was attracted to this sweater because of the pretty fur collar and the color, which is a gray-black that seems to go with everything. the cut is a-line so it drapes over what you are wearing underneath. since the fabric is soft it doesn't add a lot of bulk and keeps the fit flattering even though it is not fitted. i have worn it many times since purchasing because the color and fit make it easy to throw on over your outfit for some additional warmth. personally i found that it runs very large.

    title: Perfect sweater for chilly weather
    review: Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things  ) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!

    title: Totally cute and unique

    title: Great netural top.
    review: This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.a great staple for your closet.

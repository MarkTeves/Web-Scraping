    title: Adorable and flattering
    review: This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.

    title: Way too large everywhere
    review: I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves, but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall, it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.

    title: Great summer top
    review: I tried on this top in store & was a bit wishy washy on it at first. however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it 3x in a week (shh!). it is incredibly lightweight & breathable which is great for hot texas summers. i also love that it has interesting back detail. the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i don't agree - i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues. it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim & fancier accessories. either way it looks best w

    title: Lovely top
    review: This top is lovely and flowy! it fits true to size, and the lace detail at the neck is perfect to make this top stand out. i felt like it was a little sheer, but it wasn't problematic enough for me to take away a star  -)

    title: Sold on reviews
    review: After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 14 was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too.

    title: Simply love
    review: This sweater is substantial, well-made, fabric is thick and comfortable. the length is on the shorter side, not cropped but shorter, perhaps if they had petite, ti would be cropped. the sleeves are perfect length too on me, it looks shorter on the model, they hit at mys wrists (i do usually need petite length). it seems a simple top, but it is quite beautiful in person. i strongly recommend it, even for the price...xs and i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist

    title: Beauty and the beast
    review: I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area, or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule, but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"

    title: Super cute shirt
    review: I just bought this shirt on sale. i'd been eyeing it for a bit and when it went on sale i had to get it. its really cute and comfortable and fits really nicely. it's not too short or boxy and the detail on the sleeves is great.

    review: I'm between a s & m.  on most swing tops usually s which i thought i'd be in this one but not the case. a m fit but i thought i could probably even wear a l which i never wear. but it is gorgeous. this is one of those shirts that keep me coming back to retailer. this is a perfect fall top! great tan color the beading is so so pretty and will really look great under sweaters. this top looked so great with my louis vuitton bag it was just too good to pass up so go to your local store, find th

    title: Gorgeous with a great fit
    review: I love this flattering and comfortable jacket- it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world. i think it will pack a big punch this fall.

    title: Shrinks
    review: I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.

    title: I love this!
    review: I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye.

    title: Flexible sweatering
    review: Love this sweater! it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits. it is a great, flexible add to my wardrobe. it fits well, even in the sleeves!

    title: Light and lovely.
    review: I recently purchased this tunic on sale. the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist. the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors. i wore this with black leggings,boots and a green cardigan and received many compliments.

    title: Very cute, runs large
    review: I like the casual, yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back, but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately.

    title: Fun arm detail
    review: Really enjoy this pullover's arm detail. i got the "purple" which was somewhere between aubergine and garnet. i think this will easily go with black pants to wear to work or a fun skirt/jeans.

    title: Cute!
    review: This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out, the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.

    title: Nice try...
    review: This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person, though the back was gorgeous, with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online, but was a bit more green in person. also, the armholes were very low, so it would need a camisole or no bra.

    title: Details and versatility
    review: This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!

    title: Sandstripe vest
    review: As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.

    title: Watercolor look
    review: Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium.

    title: Perfect summer basic
    review: I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit, also  it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40"  bust x 33" waist.

    title: Beautiful print, but runs very large
    review: This print is beautiful and the design is unique and great for work. my only complaint is that it runs huge and the torso fit is extremely boxy. i'm normally in between a size xs and s at retailer, bought the xs in this shirt and it still almost too big.

    title: Love the look for the holidays
    review: This velvet t-shirt is perfect for the holidays! i usually wear a size 12 top, or a l, but i ordered up and got a size xl. it is very tight around my chest (36c) and armpits, and the v-neck sometimes spreads apart a lot if i move my arms around a lot. but other than that, it looks great, just runs small. if you are a size 14 or larger, i don't think that this will fit.

    title: Pretty cropped cardigan.
    review: This cardigan is nice and the lace at the back is pretty. just be aware that it's definitely a cropped length, which is good for wearing over a dress that you don't want to cover up too much. size up if you want room to layer. the one i tried on at the store had the top button almost falling off, so i didn't buy it.

    title: Enormous
    review: I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.

    title: Perfect shirt
    review: This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry, a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight, true to size, drapes nicely and its very flattering. i"m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!

    title: Cute but won't last
    review: Wore it a couple of times, it is cool and comfortable. washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray. i might get one or two more wears out of it. hand washed and hung dry.

    title: Great find on sale!
    review: I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.

    title: Lovely fabric, not boxy
    review: I've bought similar blouses from retailer before that i didn't love as much as this. it's not boxy or wide on me. it's a great length and i find the 3/4 bell sleeves to be elegant. i bought the purple one on sale and went back for the red/cream. my only complaint would be that the stitching could be of better quality. the fabric is very nice -- love the print.

    title: Perfect...but
    review: It's an adorable take on the "casual" sweatshirt. i love the layers, but i wish they were just a little different. they hang a little strange. perhaps if the bottom one was a smidge longer? i'm not sure. or if the sweatshirt layer was a little longer and the blouse bit was therefore longer. it all hangs just a little...off? but, it's not so off that it looks bad. i'm petite, so it's cute on, but, i think if you were tall, it might hang a little weird. a warning though, i ordered a small, and the

    title: So lovely i bought two?????
    review: This top fits tts as shown on model. loose, flowy but the cut/details/flounce still give some nice shape. i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the style/make. went with the small in this. i am 5'5",narrow shoulders, ruler shape 34dd. no gaping in the front. fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top. so complimentary, it would flatter many body types. the neckline is juuuuussst right, i fasten the top button to make

    title: Easy top
    review: I like this top. another reviewer mentioned that it was a great top for a busty girl...i agree. i'm a 32g and could have sized down to a small, but i kept the medium because i wanted the extra length to have the option of wearing it as a dress. the small may have caused slight button pulling, but since the fabric has stretch and the top has a generous cut, it wouldn?t look insane. my only issue is the fabric pills. i wore the top once, and the fabric near the armpit pilled a lot, especially for

    title: Conversationalist button-down with cats
    review: I love this shirt, very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest, so i returned for the next size up.very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.

    title: Summer sweater
    review: This is a thick material, but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy, but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.

    title: Pretty but...
    review: I really had high hopes for this sweater however, unfortunately it is not as nice as i expected it to be. i own a few angel of the north sweaters and i really don't feel like this particular sweater meets their usual standard. first of all the yarn feels very cheap and is not very soft. secondly, the actual knit also appears to be very cheap. i ordered the white sweater in my usual size medium and while it fits, i really can't see how they were able to get the neck of the sweater to go off the m

    title: I love it!!
    review: I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the "denim" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!

    title: Short but wide
    review: This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.

    title: Old retailer
    review: Ok, so yes, it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little, especially if you work out, but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0, didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short, i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses, tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic, flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a

    title: Love the style
    review: I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater.

    title: Perfect and at the right price!

    title: Cozy casual - perfect for fall
    review: The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.

    title: Beautiful blouse- does run large
    review: Saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on. it was really cute on her and she loved it. in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size 0 which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes. but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale.

    title: Comfy top
    review: I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!

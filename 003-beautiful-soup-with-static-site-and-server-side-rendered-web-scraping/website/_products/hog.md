    title: Love it!
    review: Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.

    title: You'll smile on a humid summer's day
    review: This blouse is a perfect creation  perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there's fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there's no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy

    title: Love it! i wish they had it in more colors
    review: I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt, she hated it.  well, i have washed mine 2 or 3 times already and have never ironed it.  i do use fabric softener, and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about 5 minutes.  it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt, but a soft casual shirt, and as i said before, i have not ironed it once.  it looks like it did when i bought it, even straight out of the dryer.  (i own the yellow and pink!)

    title: Orange lace part runs big, but lining is small
    review: I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said, a medium would fit better and would not be so wide, but i fe

    title: So comfy and versatile!
    review: I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.

    title: Simple top
    review: This is a comfortable tunic piece with ample rear coverage. it is lightweight and there is room to layer a thin tank top underneath.the ivory is a marled heather with ivory buttons. it is not anything special in terms of style but it will serve the purpose of being a casual separate for around the house or for a quick errand.

    title: Great slouchy sweater, perfect color
    review: This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.

    title: Summer time comfort
    review: I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made, super soft, and works well with jeans, capris, skirts, and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though, this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a

    title: Comfy and practical
    review: I bought this cardigan in grey. it's sturdy, soft, great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater. the tail in back is long and unique. the shape is flattering. and for a lighter cardigan, it's more substantial than others out there. the sleeves are long enough for my long arms, which i love.

    title: Not sure what i wore before i owned this shirt!
    review: I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou

    title: Great top!
    review: I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!

    title: Gorgeous
    review: I bought this for our daughter. i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin. the purple is a stunning color - very subdued and classy. if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened, guess who is going to keep it for herself! if she loves it as much as i think she will, then i'll just have to get one for myself. the pleats in the back are very flattering. best of all is the fabric. it is luxurious. thank you retailer for yet another

    title: Good for workout
    review: This tank is really thin and airy without being too flowy. it was perfect for my soul cycle workout, and i am thinking about getting it in different colors for working out. i don't know that i'd normally wear this top on its own because it's very casual, but it's perfect as part of a workout or vacation outfit. i sized down one size to make sure that it wasn't too flowy, and it fit perfectly. i am 5'2" and 130lbs., and a size xs fit perfectly.

    title: Maeve never disappoints!

    title: Flattering
    review: I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!

    title: A great jacket!
    review: I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.

    title: Not as pictured
    review: This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on

    title: This blouse has lovely features
    review: The blouse is lightweight and is double layered, meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1, a bit busty, and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.

    review: This is a very pretty blouse with a vintage, romantic looking fabric. the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely. i love the colors...black, brown, and cream. it's hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown. the long tie adds a romantic feel. this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank. i actually love the blouse, but returned it because it is super blousy. i am 5'2", 140 lbs., and the small was fine. it is just so blousy, that even belting it didn

    review: I thought i'd add a review because a lot of this landscape-print tee was still available at my local durham, nc store (the week after xmas anyway). it's a little different in person than how it appeared online (when it was still available). the white cotton is definitely a cream or off-white. and the silkscreen is darker colors and much more metallic than shown. the metallic is a subtle gold. it's definitely 3/4 sleeves, which i like and it has a curved bottom hem. the surprise to me was that it

    review: Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2", 115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this.

    review: I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length, hem, neckline, etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well

    review: I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did. while it is by no means work appropriate, it is a fun top for a night out. the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy. i tried it on with jeans, shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items. wish this came in a few other colors. for reference, i am a 36dd and a size 12, took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish.

    review: Deletta has done it again, designed a top that is unique, flattering, and comfortable. the blue is an intense peacock blue. the only draw back about this top (and with other deletta tops) is that they leave some of the fabric with raw unfinished edges. for this top it is located at the hole the twist creates. it's hidden but i worry about it fraying after a few washes. not sure why they couldn't continue the zigzagging at that opening. perhaps it wasn't cost effective to sew five more inches of

    review: I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.

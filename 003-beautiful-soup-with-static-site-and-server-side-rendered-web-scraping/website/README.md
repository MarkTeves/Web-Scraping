This is heavily based upon [CloudCannon/fur-jekyll-template](https://github.com/CloudCannon/fur-jekyll-template) modified for use for this workshop! This does **not** have a database or any backend to it at all, the main purpose of this website in the workshop is to teach static site web scraping with Beautiful Soup.
